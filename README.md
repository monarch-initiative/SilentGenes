![Java CI with Maven](https://github.com/ielis/SilentGenes/workflows/Java%20CI%20with%20Maven/badge.svg)

A library that lets you silently work with genes and transcripts.

The project is currently in *pre-alpha* stage.

## Library structure

*Silent genes* consists of several modules:
- 
- `silent-genes-model` defines the common properties of genes and transcripts,
- `silent-genes-gencode` provides genes and transcripts as specified by [Gencode consortium](https://www.gencodegenes.org/),
- `silent-genes-jannovar` provides genes and transcripts from the [Jannovar](https://github.com/charite/jannovar) transcript databases,
- `silent-genes-simple` gives you a handful of real-life genes, mostly useful for unit testing
